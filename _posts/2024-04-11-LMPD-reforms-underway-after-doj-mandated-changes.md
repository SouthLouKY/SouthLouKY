It has been 13 months since the Department of Justice released their 90 page document relating to the investigation of the Louisville Metro Police Department. This investigation 
highlighted 60 incidents of alleged misconduct, and by 2022 nine former officers were indicted in federal court. The DOJ has recommended 35 changes be implemented to improve the performance 
of the department. Now, in October of 2023, they formed the Force Investigation Review Unit, they now review all incidents of use of force, pursuits, and incidents involving forced entry into homes. 
As the LMPD continues reforms, the DOJ is hosting community meetings so community members can voice their ideas.
