On Wednesday, April 10th, at 6:00 PM EST, the JCPS board held a meeting following a request of approval to move forward with a transportation plan for the 2024-2025 school year.
During this meeting, tensions rose as board members were often heard yelling at each other. This meeting lasted for over 2 hours, with the biggest concern being limiting school choice options for students of color.
Board Chair Corrie Shull stated "We want to make sure every student that is part of Jefferson County Schools has access to choice, and the plan that was approved tonight undermines that."
Students who would still receive transportation include those attending their reside school, and other students required by state and/or federal law to receive transportation, like those who have it included in their individualized education program (IEP).
Hundreds of parents and students showed up waiting for a decision to be made by the board, and upon a decision being made, many parents and students were unhappy.
Central and Western High Schools will not lose their traditional/magnet transportation as more than 75% of students are on free or reduced lunch.
