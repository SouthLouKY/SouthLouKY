Welcome to the Association of Southern Louisville, Kentucky! We are a non-governmental organization dedicated to helping the Southern Louisville community. Our goal is to provide awareness to crime, provide resources to those that need them the most, and host community outreach events at public spaces. This particular section of the website will be used for news posts, as we are an un-biased, non-political alternative outlet that has a goal of being as trusted as possible by the Louisville community. You can expect posts like this to be regulary added to the website, and if you'd like to submit any information to us, you can do so via email (contact@southlouky.com).

The "projects" section of the website will contain all relevant information pertaining to events and projects we are working on that will come to the South Louisville area. If you'd like to participate in an event, stay tuned for articles that are posted to that section! Thank you for reading, and we look forward to what we can provide for the South Louisville area!
